A sample project demonstrating how to make a simple Bixby capsule. A full
tutorial of how to build this capsule [can be found on my website!](https://kevinmloeffler.com/2018/11/07/making-your-first-capsule-for-samsung-bixby-an-exercise-in-teaching-your-phone-to-listen/)

This capsule is a random password generator inspired by the 'CorrectHorseBatteryStaple'
algorithm described in [XKCD's Password Strength comic](https://xkcd.com/936/).

### Prerequisites

You will need to download and install [Bixby Studio](https://bixbydevelopers.com) for your platform.
